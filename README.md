# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) App

This is a basic, beginner friendly RAG app for personalised interaction with your uploaded documents. 

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the app:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayesha-Imr/gdg-RAG.git
cd gdg-RAG
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

#### On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv myvenv
myvenv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv myvenv
source myvenv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install the Requirements

Install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up API Keys

The app requires two API keys:

1. **Cohere API Key**
   - Visit [Cohere API Key Page](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys)
   - Log in or sign up to generate your free API key.

2. **Groq API Key**
   - Visit [Groq API Key Page](https://console.groq.com/keys)
   - Log in or sign up to generate your free API key.

Once you have both keys, do the following:

- Open the `env.txt` file in the root directory.
- Paste the API keys into the appropriate placeholders. The format should look like this:

```plaintext
COHERE_API_KEY="<your-cohere-api-key>"
GROQ_API_KEY="<your-groq-api-key>"
```

- Save the file and rename it to `.env` (remove the `.txt` extension).

### 5. Run the App

Navigate to the `streamlit-app` folder:

```bash
cd streamlit-app
```

Run the app using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 6. Access the App

After running the command, Streamlit will provide a local URL. Open the URL in your browser to start using the app.
